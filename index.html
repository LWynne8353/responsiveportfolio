        Hello, I am Liam Wynne and I am trying to be a developer of websites beyond websites, developers GO! (little
        "Thunder Cats reference"). I currently reside in the Manayunk area of Philadelphia, PA. For years and still, I
        worked in restaurants started out as a dishwasher and moved myself up to management.
        My favorite hobbies are listening to music, playing volleyball and darts (don't worry it is not a the same time
        but would be fun to try it though),and recently experiencing new cultures by traveling to different countries.
